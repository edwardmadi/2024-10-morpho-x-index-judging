# Insufficient Reentrancy Protection in `ripcord` Function Due to Reliance on `onlyEOA` Modifier

### Summary
**Very similar issue as in [this Sherlock report](https://solodit.cyfrin.io/issues/m-15-onlyeoaex-modifier-that-ensures-call-is-from-eoa-might-not-hold-true-in-the-future-sherlock-blueberry-blueberry-git)**

The `ripcord` function in the `MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension` contract relies on the `onlyEOA` modifier to restrict access to externally owned accounts (EOAs). However, this check is insufficient as a reentrancy guard. Without proper reentrancy protection, the function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, which could lead to unintended state changes or financial loss.

### Root Cause

The contract uses the `onlyEOA` modifier, which checks `msg.sender == tx.origin`, to ensure that only EOAs can call the `ripcord` function. This approach is not a substitute for a reentrancy guard because it does not prevent contracts from re-entering functions during execution. Additionally, future Ethereum proposals like EIP-3074 could allow contracts to impersonate EOAs, rendering the `onlyEOA` check ineffective.


### Code Location

- **File:** `MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol`
- **Function:** [`ripcord`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L396)

```solidity
modifier onlyEOA() {
    require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Must be EOA address");
    _;
}

function ripcord(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA {
    // Function logic...
    uint256 etherTransferred = _transferEtherRewardToCaller(incentive.etherReward);
    //...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract holds an Ether balance sufficient to pay the incentive reward.
- The `ripcord` function is callable and intended to be used during high leverage situations.


### External Pre-conditions

- An attacker can deploy a malicious contract designed to exploit reentrancy.
- The attacker is motivated to drain the contract's Ether balance or manipulate its state.


### Attack Path

1. **Preparation:** The attacker deploys a malicious contract capable of re-entering the `ripcord` function.
2. **Invocation:** The attacker calls the `ripcord` function via their malicious contract.
3. **Reentrancy:** During the Ether transfer in `_transferEtherRewardToCaller`, the attacker re-enters the `ripcord` function.
4. **Exploitation:** The attacker repeats this process to drain Ether rewards or manipulate the contract state.


### Impact

- **Financial Loss:** The attacker can drain the Ether balance allocated for rewards.
- **State Manipulation:** Unintended changes to leverage positions or other sensitive state variables.
- **Contract Disruption:** The contract may behave unpredictably or enter an invalid state.


### Estimated Loss

The attacker could potentially drain all Ether allocated for incentives. The exact amount depends on the contract's Ether balance but could be significant.


### Mitigation

- **Implement Reentrancy Guard:** Use a reentrancy guard, such as OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`, to prevent reentrancy attacks.

  ```solidity
  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

  contract MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension is BaseExtension, ReentrancyGuard {
      //...

      function ripcord(string memory _exchangeName) external nonReentrant onlyEOA {
          // Function logic...
      }
  }
  ```

- **Avoid Reliance on `onlyEOA`:** Do not rely solely on `onlyEOA` for security-critical functions.

### Conclusion

The reliance on the `onlyEOA` modifier in the `ripcord` function is insufficient for reentrancy protection. Implementing proper reentrancy guards ensures the function is secure against reentrancy attacks, both now and in the future, even if Ethereum's capabilities evolve.
