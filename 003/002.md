# Lack of Access Control on setManager Leading to Unauthorized Manager Updates

### Summary

The **setManager** function lacks proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized entities from updating the manager address. Without adequate restrictions, malicious actors could exploit this to set a malicious manager, compromising the entire protocol.

### Root Cause

The **setManager** function is protected solely by the onlyOperator modifier, which may not be sufficient if the operator role is compromised. Additionally, there is no multi-signature requirement or timelock mechanism to enhance security for critical administrative functions.

Location: **BaseManager.sol** - **setManager** function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManager.sol#L123

**Code Snippet:**

```solidity 
/**
 * MUTUAL UPGRADE: Update the SetToken manager address. Operator and Methodologist must each call
 * this function to execute the update.
 *
 * @param _newManager           New manager address
 */
function setManager(address _newManager) external onlyOperator {
    require(_newManager != address(0), "Zero address not valid");
    setToken.setManager(_newManager);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1.Role: Operator needs to call **setManager** to set **_newManager** to a valid address (non-zero).


### External pre-conditions

1.N/A: The function does not interact with external protocols beyond setting the manager in **setToken**.
 

### Attack Path


1. An attacker compromises the operator account.


2. The attacker calls setManager with a malicious **_newManager** address.


3. The malicious manager gains control over the **SetToken**, enabling unauthorized actions such as adding/removing modules or adapters, draining funds, or disrupting protocol operations.





### Impact

Impact: The protocol suffers a critical security breach where the attacker can control the **SetToken** through the malicious manager. This can lead to loss of funds, unauthorized state changes, and complete disruption of protocol functionality.


### PoC


```solidity 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.6.10;

import "./BaseManager.sol";

contract UnauthorizedManagerSetter {
    BaseManager public baseManager;
    address public maliciousManager;

    constructor(address _baseManager, address _maliciousManager) public {
        baseManager = BaseManager(_baseManager);
        maliciousManager = _maliciousManager;
    }

    // Function to set a malicious manager
    function setMaliciousManager() external {
        baseManager.setManager(maliciousManager);
    }
}
```
Explanation: If an attacker gains control of the operator role, they can deploy the **UnauthorizedManagerSetter** contract and call **setMaliciousManager** to set the manager to a malicious address, compromising the entire protocol

### Mitigation

**Mitigation**: Implement multi-signature requirements or a timelock mechanism for critical administrative functions like **setManager**. This ensures that multiple trusted parties must approve such changes, reducing the risk of unauthorized updates.

Proposed Code Modification with Multi-Signature:
```solidity 

// Add state variables for multi-signature approval
address public pendingManager;
uint256 public approvalCount;
uint256 public constant REQUIRED_APPROVALS = 2;

/**
 * Initiate the manager update process by proposing a new manager.
 *
 * @param _newManager New manager address
 */
function proposeManager(address _newManager) external onlyOperator {
    require(_newManager != address(0), "Zero address not valid");
    pendingManager = _newManager;
    approvalCount = 1; // Operator has approved
    emit ManagerProposed(_newManager);
}

/**
 * Approve the proposed manager update by the methodologist.
 */
function approveManager() external onlyMethodologist {
    require(pendingManager != address(0), "No manager proposed");
    approvalCount += 1;
    emit ManagerApproval(msg.sender, approvalCount);

    if (approvalCount >= REQUIRED_APPROVALS) {
        setToken.setManager(pendingManager);
        emit ManagerUpdated(pendingManager);
        pendingManager = address(0);
        approvalCount = 0;
    }
}

event ManagerProposed(address indexed newManager);
event ManagerApproval(address indexed approver, uint256 approvalCount);
event ManagerUpdated(address indexed newManager);

```
Explanation:

Introduce a two-step process where the operator proposes a new manager, and the methodologist approves it.

Emit events to track proposals and approvals.

Only execute the manager update once the required number of approvals is met, ensuring mutual consent.
