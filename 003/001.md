# Inconsistent Mutual Upgrade Mechanism in setManager Function

### Summary

The **setManager** function is intended to require mutual agreement between the operator and methodologist to update the manager address. However, the implementation allows only the operator to execute this function, bypassing the intended mutual upgrade mechanism. This inconsistency can lead to unauthorized manager updates if the operator is compromised.

### Root Cause

In **BaseManager.sol**, the **setManager** function is documented to require mutual approval from both the operator and methodologist for upgrading the manager. However, the function is protected solely by the **onlyOperator** modifier, allowing only the operator to call it.

Location: **BaseManager.sol** - **setManager** function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/manager/BaseManager.sol#L123

**Code Snippet:**
```solidity
/**solidity 
 * MUTUAL UPGRADE: Update the SetToken manager address. Operator and Methodologist must each call
 * this function to execute the update.
 *
 * @param _newManager           New manager address
 */
function setManager(address _newManager) external onlyOperator {
    require(_newManager != address(0), "Zero address not valid");
    setToken.setManager(_newManager);
}



```

### Internal pre-conditions

1.Role: **Operator** needs to call **setManager** to set **_newManager** to a valid address (non-zero).

### External pre-conditions

1.N/A: The function does not interact with external protocols beyond setting the manager in setToken.

### Attack Path

1. The operator calls **setManager** with a malicious or unintended **_newManager** address.


2. The malicious manager gains control over the **SetToken**, allowing it to perform unauthorized actions such as adding/removing modules or adapters, potentially compromising the entire protocol.



### Impact

The protocol suffers a significant security breach where the attacker (acting as the operator) can arbitrarily change the manager address. This allows the attacker to control the **SetToken**, manipulate adapters, and potentially drain funds or disrupt protocol operations.

### PoC

```solidity 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.6.10;

import "./BaseManager.sol";

contract MaliciousOperator {
    BaseManager public baseManager;
    address public maliciousManager;

    constructor(address _baseManager, address _maliciousManager) public {
        baseManager = BaseManager(_baseManager);
        maliciousManager = _maliciousManager;
    }

    // Assume this contract is set as the operator
    function executeAttack() external {
        baseManager.setManager(maliciousManager);
    }
}

```
Explanation: If an attacker gains control of the operator role, they can deploy the MaliciousOperator contract and call executeAttack to set the manager to a malicious address. This new manager can then perform unauthorized actions on the **SetToken**.

### Mitigation

Mitigation: Implement a true mutual upgrade mechanism by requiring both the operator and methodologist to approve the **setManager** action. This can be achieved by introducing a two-step process where both roles must confirm the update before it is executed.

**Proposed Code Modification:**

```solidity
// Add state variables to track approvals
bool public operatorApproved;
bool public methodologistApproved;

/**solidity
 * MUTUAL UPGRADE: Update the SetToken manager address. Operator and Methodologist must each call
 * this function to execute the update.
 *
 * @param _newManager           New manager address
 */
function setManager(address _newManager) external {
    require(_newManager != address(0), "Zero address not valid");

    if (msg.sender == operator) {
        operatorApproved = true;
    } else if (msg.sender == methodologist) {
        methodologistApproved = true;
    } else {
        revert("Caller is not authorized");
    }

    if (operatorApproved && methodologistApproved) {
        setToken.setManager(_newManager);
        operatorApproved = false;
        methodologistApproved = false;
        emit ManagerUpdated(_newManager);
    }
}

event ManagerUpdated(address _newManager);

```
**Explanation:**

Introduce approval flags for both operator and methodologist.

Require both roles to call setManager with the same **_newManager** before the manager is updated.

Reset approval flags after successful update to prevent reuse.
