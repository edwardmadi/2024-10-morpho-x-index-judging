# Morphol.sol functions are public hence non-validated isetToken.sol can lead to Stolen Funds

### Summary

 morpho.sol has all its functions as external. ```function getSupplyCollateralCalldata, function invokeSupplyCollateral,function getBorrowCalldata
  function invokeBorrow,    function getWithdrawCollateralCalldata, function invokeWithdrawCollateral
  function invokeRepay, ``` 
a malicious actor can deploy a malicious ```isetToken.sol```. and front-run an actual transaction that deposits  asset and shares that into the actual ```isetToken.sol```simply because it is not validated.
   
  



I1. malicious actor deploys a contract that implements the ISetToken interface but contains harmful logic
2.  when a honest user calls any function in morpho.sol , he frontruns it so as to achieve;
Redirecting of Funds: The malicious contract could redirect borrowed assets to an unintended 
address or drain funds.
Manipulate State: They could manipulate the state of the lending protocol in a way that benefits
 them at the expense of other users or the protocol itself.
Reentrancy Attacks:  the malicious contract calls back into the Morpho library and can claim ownership roles, completely hacking the protocol
