# MorphoLeverageModule#deleverToZeroBorrowBalance can leave unused approvals causing later repayments to fail for USDT

### Summary

USDT approvals will revert if the current allowance is greater than 0. Under most circumstances the contract approves and utilizes entire allowance but due to small rounding errors `MorphoLeverageModule#deleverToZeroBorrowBalance` can leave very small allowances. This causes future repayments to revert.

### Root Cause

[MorphoLeverageModule:L742-L749](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/MorphoLeverageModule.sol#L742-L749) can leave very small allowances due to approving `_notionalQuantity` but repaying `_shares` due to rounding

### Internal pre-conditions

1. USDT (or other tokens that enforce 0 balance approves) must be the loan token
2. The set must have been deleveraged to zero previously
3. Set token must be re-engaged

### External pre-conditions

Underlying asset price decreases

### Attack Path

1. The token is delevered to zero borrow balance
2. The token re-engaged and releveraged
3. Any calls to deleverage will revert when approving `USDT` for repayment
5. Set token risks liquidation

### Impact

Set token suffers losses due to liquidation fee. For most Morpho markets this is at least 5%. Due to the leveraged nature of the set the loss will be multiplicative. This means a 3x leverage token will lose 15% NAV (5% * 3), 5x leverage will lose 25% NAV (5% * 5), etc.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following line to removing hanging approval:
