# MorphoBalancesLib.sol :: expectedMarketBalances() fees are not subtracted from totalBorrowAssets and totalSupplyAssets, leading to incorrect market balances being returned.

### Summary

**`expectedMarketBalances()`** is used by integrators to calculate the projected market balances after interest accrual. However, when a market has fees, the issue arises where the **`feeAmount`** is not subtracted from **`totalBorrowAssets`** and **`totalSupplyAssets`**. This results in inflated values and incorrect market balances being returned.

### Root Cause

[expectedMarketBalances()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/2f125406e0dd3b1fc029b9a47fe97bfbf906fce2/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/lib/MorphoBalancesLib.sol#L32-L60) is implemented as follows.
```Solidity
function expectedMarketBalances(IMorpho morpho, MarketParams memory marketParams)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256)
    {
        bytes32 id = marketParams.id();
        Market memory market = morpho.market(id);

        uint256 elapsed = block.timestamp - market.lastUpdate;

        // Skipped if elapsed == 0 or totalBorrowAssets == 0 because interest would be null, or if irm == address(0).
        if (elapsed != 0 && market.totalBorrowAssets != 0 && marketParams.irm != address(0)) {
            uint256 borrowRate = IIrm(marketParams.irm).borrowRateView(marketParams, market);
            
            uint256 interest = market.totalBorrowAssets.wMulDown(borrowRate.wTaylorCompounded(elapsed));
            market.totalBorrowAssets += interest.toUint128();
            market.totalSupplyAssets += interest.toUint128();

            if (market.fee != 0) {
                uint256 feeAmount = interest.wMulDown(market.fee);
                // The fee amount is subtracted from the total supply in this calculation to compensate for the fact
                // that total supply is already updated.
                uint256 feeShares =
                    feeAmount.toSharesDown(market.totalSupplyAssets - feeAmount, market.totalSupplyShares);
                market.totalSupplyShares += feeShares.toUint128();
            }
        }

        return (market.totalSupplyAssets, market.totalSupplyShares, market.totalBorrowAssets, market.totalBorrowShares);
    }
```
As you can see, when the market has a fee, the **`feeAmount`** is calculated from the accrued interest. However, this fee is not subtracted from **`market.totalSupplyAssets`** and **`market.totalBorrowAssets`**, which results in incorrectly inflated values being returned.

### Internal pre-conditions

**`market.fee != 0`**

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

**`market.totalBorrowAssets`** and **`market.totalSupplyAssets`** will be inflated, leading to incorrect market balances being returned.



### PoC

The previous sections have demonstrated the issue.

### Mitigation

To resolve the issue, subtract the **`feeAmount`** from **`market.totalBorrowAssets`** and **`market.totalSupplyAssets`**.

        return (market.totalSupplyAssets, market.totalSupplyShares, market.totalBorrowAssets, market.totalBorrowShares);
    }
