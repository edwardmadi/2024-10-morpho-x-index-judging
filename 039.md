# incorrect slippage in _calculateMinRepayUnits

### Summary


The _calculateMinRepayUnits function calculates the repayment amount needed to reduce leverage on a debt position, taking into account the acceptable slippage when repaying the debt. However, the implementation of slippage in the calculation is incorrect.

    function _calculateMinRepayUnits(uint256 _collateralRebalanceUnits, uint256 _slippageTolerance, ActionInfo memory _actionInfo) internal virtual pure returns (uint256) {
        return _collateralRebalanceUnits
            .mul(_actionInfo.collateralPrice).div(MORPHO_ORACLE_PRICE_SCALE)
            .preciseMul(PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit().sub(_slippageTolerance));
    }


the function subtracts the slippage tolerance. This is incorrect because, when accounting for acceptable slippage, the calculation should add the acceptable percentage instead of subtracting it. As a result, the function will calculate the minimum repayment amount incorrectly, attempting to repay less than intended due to the misapplication of the slippage tolerance.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

this will cause  unnecessary revert when trying to repay/deleverage even when the slippage is within acceptable range which can temporarily dos the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To correct this, the calculation should add the slippage tolerance.
