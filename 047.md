# The exchange time is updated even when no exchange occurs.

### Summary

`iterateRebalance` is used to continuously exchange to reach the target leverage ratio.  When the leverage ratio has reached the target value, the exchange will not be sent and twapLeverageRatio will be reset. However, in the function _updateIterateState, the exchange time is updated at the same time, which causes the exchange to be cooled down for a period of time.
