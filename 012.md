# Unchecked Return Values to Manipulate Balances in MorphoBalancesLib.sol

### Summary

A failure to check return values in MorphoBalancesLib.sol can cause loss of funds for the protocol as unchecked return values allow unexpected behaviors during token transfers when an attacker manipulates the return data.

### Root Cause

In MorphoBalancesLib.sol, the functions interacting with external token contracts do not verify the success of these operations by checking their return values.

example

`
_transfer(token, to, amount);
`

### Internal pre-conditions

The MorphoBalancesLib library must call an external token contract's transfer or transferFrom function.

### External pre-conditions

An attacker deploys a malicious ERC20 token contract that always returns false or reverts on transfer or transferFrom.

### Attack Path

The attacker deploys a malicious ERC20 token that overrides the transfer and transferFrom functions to return false without reverting. The attacker configures the system to use the malicious token within the MorphoBalancesLib.sol contract. The attacker initiates a token transfer through the vulnerable functions in MorphoBalancesLib.sol. The contract fails to check the return value of the transfer, incorrectly updating internal balances as if the transfer succeeded. The attacker exploits the inaccurate internal state to withdraw more tokens than they are entitled to, draining funds from the contract.

### Impact

Users may suffer a loss of the specific percentage of their token holdings due to incorrect balance updates and unauthorized withdrawals. The attacker gains additional tokens without providing the corresponding collateral, undermining the integrity of the protocol and leading to financial losses and reputational damage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Always Check Return Values: Ensure that all ERC20 token transfer functions (transfer, transferFrom, and approve) are checked for their return values. Use require statements to handle failed transfers.

`
require(token.transfer(to, amount), "Transfer failed");
`

Utilize OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library, which wraps ERC20 operations and checks their return values.
