# ripcord uses transfer instead of call which can break with future updates to gas costs

### Summary

The use of transfer in the function _transferEtherRewardToCaller which is being internally called by ripcord can revert if the transaction requires more then 2300 gas, thus making this function to revert and function ripcord will not be excecuted, if in the future the gas prices of the opcodes like SLOAD increases then the 2300 gas used in transfer might be insufficient

### Root Cause

When the function _transferEtherRewardToCaller(uint256 _etherReward) in (MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol) is internally called via ripcord it uses  msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer);

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The ripcord function will not be excecuted making the current leverage ratio to not delever to the max keverage ratio,also users will not be able to get the incentivized ether reward for calling the ripcord function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To avoid this issue, you can replace the transfer method with a call method that allows you to specify a dynamic amount of gas, like this
// Replace this:
msg.sender.transfer(etherToTransfer);

// With this:
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: etherToTransfer}("");
require(success, "Ether transfer failed");
