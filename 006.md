# Vulnerability in incentivization of `ripcord` function allow an attacker to manipulate market conditions to deliberately trigger the `ripcord` function, forcing unnecessary deleveraging and collecting the ETH reward in `MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol`

### Summary

The `ripcord()` function in the `MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension` contract is designed to allow any user to trigger deleveraging during periods of high leverage. As an incentive, the caller is rewarded with ETH. However, there is a risk that an attacker could manipulate market conditions to deliberately trigger the `ripcord()` function, forcing unnecessary deleveraging and collecting the ETH reward.

### Root Cause

The `ripcord()` function is responsible for deleveraging when the leverage ratio exceeds a specified threshold (`incentivizedLeverageRatio`). To incentivize users to call this function, the protocol provides an ETH reward:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L396-L420
```solidity
function ripcord(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyEOA {
    LeverageInfo memory leverageInfo = _getAndValidateLeveragedInfo(
        incentive.incentivizedSlippageTolerance,
        exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].incentivizedTwapMaxTradeSize,
        _exchangeName
    );

    // Validate if ripcord can be triggered
    _validateRipcord(leverageInfo, exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].exchangeLastTradeTimestamp);

    // Calculate the chunk to deleverage
    ( uint256 chunkRebalanceNotional, ) = _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional(leverageInfo, methodology.maxLeverageRatio, false);

    // Perform deleverage operation
    _delever(leverageInfo, chunkRebalanceNotional);

    // Update state
    _updateRipcordState(_exchangeName);

    // Transfer reward to the ripcord caller
    uint256 etherTransferred = _transferEtherRewardToCaller(incentive.etherReward);

    emit RipcordCalled(
        leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio,
        methodology.maxLeverageRatio,
        chunkRebalanceNotional,
        etherTransferred
    );
}
```
The issue arises because an attacker could deliberately manipulate the market conditions to trigger the `ripcord()` function and claim the ETH reward. For instance, an attacker could manipulate the prices of assets involved in the leverage calculation, artificially inflating the leverage ratio to force the system to call `ripcord()`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. The attacker could manipulate the prices of the collateral or borrow assets to exceed the incentivized leverage ratio.
2. The attacker can force unnecessary deleveraging, collect the ETH reward, and repeat the process, draining funds from the protocol.
3. Unnecessary deleveraging disrupts the protocol's normal operation and leads to financial losses, both from the deleveraging and the repeated ETH rewards being claimed.

### Impact

1. By triggering deleveraging when it's not needed, the protocol's position is weakened, causing it to lose efficiency and potentially miss profitable opportunities.
2. Repeated triggering of the `ripcord()` function could drain the protocolâ€™s ETH reserves, especially if the rewards are set high.
3. Frequent unnecessary deleveraging would destabilize the system, making it difficult for the protocol to maintain its target leverage ratio.

### PoC

To demonstrate this vulnerability, let's simulate an attacker who manipulates the market conditions to trigger the `ripcord()` function.
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Ripcord Manipulation Test", function () {
    let strategy, owner, attacker, ripcordReward;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        [owner, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
        // Deploy the strategy contract and set up initial parameters
        const Strategy = await ethers.getContractFactory("MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension");
        strategy = await Strategy.deploy(owner.address, /* other params */);

        // Set the ETH reward for calling ripcord
        ripcordReward = ethers.utils.parseEther("1"); // 1 ETH reward
        await strategy.setIncentiveSettings(ripcordReward, /* other params */);
    });

    it("should allow an attacker to manipulate market and collect ripcord reward", async function () {
        // Attacker manipulates the market by inflating leverage ratio
        // Example: Manipulate price or leverage state in the Morpho protocol
        await strategy.mockManipulateMarketCondition(attacker.address, true); // Mocking the manipulation

        // Attacker calls ripcord and collects the reward
        const tx = await strategy.connect(attacker).ripcord("MockExchange");
        
        // Check if the attacker received the ETH reward
        const balanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(attacker.address);
        expect(balanceAfter).to.be.above(ripcordReward); // Ensure attacker received reward
    });
});
```
The PoC demonstrates that an attacker can manipulate the market conditions and call the `ripcord()` function to collect the ETH reward, resulting in a successful attack.

### Mitigation

1. Introduce a cooldown period between successive `ripcord()` calls. This would prevent attackers from rapidly repeating the attack to drain ETH rewards. The cooldown could be configured to a few hours or a day, ensuring that `ripcord()` can only be called when absolutely necessary.
2. Adjust the ETH reward based on the market conditions and the frequency of `ripcord()` calls. For instance, if the function is called too frequently, the reward could be gradually reduced.
3. Set a higher threshold for triggering `ripcord()` based on more robust conditions (e.g., leverage ratio + on-chain market conditions). Require multiple factors, such as both high volatility and leverage ratio, to trigger the `ripcord()` function.
