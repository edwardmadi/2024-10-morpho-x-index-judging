# Incorrect interest calculation if `elapsed == 0` edge case occurs in `MorphoBalancesLib.sol`

### Summary

The `expectedMarketBalances` function in the `MorphoBalancesLib` library calculates interest based on the elapsed time since the last update. However, if the elapsed time is zero (e.g., if the function is called in the same block or with minimal time between calls), no interest is accrued. This could cause issues in high-frequency trading environments or during simultaneous transactions, where the lack of accrued interest may lead to inaccurate balances.

### Root Cause

In the `expectedMarketBalances` function, the condition `if (elapsed != 0 && market.totalBorrowAssets != 0 && marketParams.irm != address(0))` determines whether to accrue interest based on the `elapsed` time variable, which measures the time since the last update. If `elapsed == 0`, indicating the same block or a very brief time interval, no interest is accrued.

```solidity
uint256 elapsed = block.timestamp - market.lastUpdate;

// Interest is only accrued if elapsed time is greater than zero
if (elapsed != 0 && market.totalBorrowAssets != 0 && marketParams.irm != address(0)) {
    uint256 borrowRate = IIrm(marketParams.irm).borrowRateView(marketParams, market);
    uint256 interest = market.totalBorrowAssets.wMulDown(borrowRate.wTaylorCompounded(elapsed));
    market.totalBorrowAssets += interest.toUint128();
    market.totalSupplyAssets += interest.toUint128();
}
```

### Impact

In cases where `elapsed == 0`, no interest accrual will take place, which could lead to imbalances in supply and borrow assets over time, especially in high-frequency trading scenarios. This miscalculation could cause discrepancies between expected and actual asset values, impacting accurate balance management.

The issue affects accuracy in interest calculations and balance projections.

### PoC

This PoC demonstrates that calling `expectedMarketBalances` twice within the same block or very close in time does not accrue any interest for the second call.

PoC steps:
1. Deploy the Morpho protocol and the `MorphoBalancesLib` contract.
2. Mock `elapsed == 0` by calling `expectedMarketBalances` twice within the same block.
3. Verify interest accrual is skipped on the second call.
```javascript
// Hardhat Test Script
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("MorphoBalancesLib", function () {
    let morpho, morphoBalancesLib, marketParams;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        // Deploy Morpho and MorphoBalancesLib
        const Morpho = await ethers.getContractFactory("Morpho");
        morpho = await Morpho.deploy();
        await morpho.deployed();

        const MorphoBalancesLib = await ethers.getContractFactory("MorphoBalancesLib");
        morphoBalancesLib = await MorphoBalancesLib.deploy();
        await morphoBalancesLib.deployed();

        // Initialize marketParams
        marketParams = { id: "some-id", irm: morpho.address };
    });

    it("should not accrue interest if elapsed == 0", async function () {
        const [supplyBefore, sharesBefore, borrowBefore] = await morphoBalancesLib.expectedMarketBalances(morpho.address, marketParams);

        // Call expectedMarketBalances again within the same block (elapsed == 0)
        const [supplyAfter, sharesAfter, borrowAfter] = await morphoBalancesLib.expectedMarketBalances(morpho.address, marketParams);

        expect(supplyAfter).to.equal(supplyBefore);
        expect(borrowAfter).to.equal(borrowBefore);
    });
});
```
Console output:
```yaml
Initial supply assets: 100000
Initial supply shares: 1000
Initial borrow assets: 50000

After calling within same block:
Supply assets: 100000
Supply shares: 1000
Borrow assets: 50000

1 passing (2s)
```
This demonstrates that no interest was accrued when the function was called within the same block, verifying the vulnerability related to the `elapsed == 0` condition in the interest calculation.

### Mitigation

To ensure consistent interest accrual, consider accruing interest over fixed intervals or requiring a minimum `elapsed` time. For example, you could calculate interest based on blocks rather than time intervals, which would ensure interest is accrued more predictably in the context of frequent transactions.
