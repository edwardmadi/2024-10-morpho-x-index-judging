# Unnecessary exposure in `getCurrentEtherIncentive` can be exploited by attackers to monitor the rewards and deliberately manipulate market conditions to trigger ripcord and collect the ETH reward in `MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol`

### Summary

The function `getCurrentEtherIncentive` reveals sensitive information about the ETH rewards available for triggering the `ripcord` function when the leverage ratio exceeds the incentivized leverage threshold. This unnecessary exposure can be exploited by attackers to monitor the rewards and deliberately manipulate market conditions to trigger `ripcord` and collect the ETH reward.

### Root Cause

The `getCurrentEtherIncentive` function calculates and exposes the ETH reward available for a successful ripcord action, making it publicly accessible to any user:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L690-L699
```solidity
function getCurrentEtherIncentive() external view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 currentLeverageRatio = getCurrentLeverageRatio();

    if (currentLeverageRatio >= incentive.incentivizedLeverageRatio) {
        // If ETH reward is below the balance on this contract, then return ETH balance on contract instead
        return incentive.etherReward < address(this).balance ? incentive.etherReward : address(this).balance;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```
This function allows anyone to call it and determine the exact amount of ETH that would be rewarded if the `ripcord()` function is called. Since this function does not restrict access, it can be exploited by attackers who:
1. Monitor the available ETH reward.
2. Manipulate market conditions (e.g., manipulate collateral or borrow asset prices) to push the leverage ratio above the incentivized threshold.
3. Call `ripcord()` to collect the ETH reward when it becomes profitable.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Attackers can monitor the ETH reward and manipulate market conditions to repeatedly trigger ripcord and collect the ETH reward, draining the contractâ€™s ETH balance.
2. The protocol will experience unnecessary deleveraging when `ripcord` is triggered by attackers, disrupting the intended leverage strategy and potentially leading to suboptimal market exposure.

### PoC

Below is a PoC using Hardhat to simulate how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling `getCurrentEtherIncentive` and then triggering the `ripcord()` function to collect the ETH reward.
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Ripcord Incentive Exploit", function () {
    let strategy, owner, attacker, ethReward;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        [owner, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

        // Deploy the strategy contract
        const Strategy = await ethers.getContractFactory("MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension");
        strategy = await Strategy.deploy(owner.address);

        // Send some ETH to the contract to simulate rewards
        ethReward = ethers.utils.parseEther("5"); // 5 ETH reward
        await owner.sendTransaction({
            to: strategy.address,
            value: ethReward
        });

        // Set up incentive reward
        const IncentiveSettings = {
            etherReward: ethReward,
            incentivizedLeverageRatio: ethers.utils.parseUnits("2", 18),
            incentivizedSlippageTolerance: ethers.utils.parseUnits("0.02", 18),
            incentivizedTwapCooldownPeriod: 60 * 60 // 1 hour cooldown
        };
        await strategy.setIncentiveSettings(IncentiveSettings);
    });

    it("attacker monitors and collects ETH incentive", async function () {
        // Attacker checks the current Ether incentive
        const incentive = await strategy.connect(attacker).getCurrentEtherIncentive();
        expect(incentive).to.equal(ethReward);

        // Attacker manipulates the market (mocked as a successful manipulation here)
        await strategy.mockManipulateMarketToIncentivizedLeverage(attacker.address);

        // Attacker triggers ripcord and collects reward
        const balanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(attacker.address);
        await strategy.connect(attacker).ripcord("MockExchange");
        const balanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(attacker.address);

        // Attacker has received the ETH reward
        expect(balanceAfter).to.be.above(balanceBefore);
    });
});
```

### Mitigation

1. Avoid publicly exposing the current ETH reward. Instead, only allow this information to be available to authorized actors or during specific events (e.g., ripcord action).
2. Introduce stricter rate limits and cooldowns for the ripcord function. This can prevent rapid consecutive calls and give the protocol time to recover from market manipulation.
3. Implement dynamic rewards that adjust based on the frequency of `ripcord` calls or market conditions. This would make it less predictable for attackers and reduce the attractiveness of repeatedly triggering `ripcord`.
