# abitrary/large data can be passed into  function getSupplyCollateralCalldata

### Summary

The type and size of data required for ```function getSupplyCollateralCalldata``` was not specified. As it is an external function, malicious actors can try pass, malicious data such an attack contract byte data to break or re-enter the code. 
Large, meaningless data can also be passed by malicous actors, overloading the system, incuring gas cost and
 causing griefing attacks or DOS

### Attack Path

1. attacker writes a malicious contract with the plan to take over  ISetToken contract .
2. attacker passes the bytecode of the contract to ``` function getSupplyCollateralCalldata``` which calls back into ``` function invokeSupplyCollateral``` which at  the end of this function IsetToken is invoked

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. specify the type/ size if data, if possible
2.  Use a re-entrant modifier from tested contracts like openzeppelin contracts
