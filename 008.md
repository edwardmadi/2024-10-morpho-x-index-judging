# Lack of events emission after sensitive actions

### Summary

Throughout the [MorphoLeverageModule contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/MorphoLeverageModule.sol), there are several cases where sensitive actions are performed but there are no events being emitted, or the existent emitted events miss important parameters.

### Root Cause

Some examples of missing events in `MorphoLeverageModule` contract:

– The `componentIssueHook` function should emit a ComponentIssued event, logging the setToken, setTokenQuantity, component, and isEquity.

– The `componentRedeemHook` function should emit a ComponentRedeemed event, logging the setToken, setTokenQuantity, component, and isEquity.

– The `getMarketId` function should emit a MarketIdRetrieved event, logging the setToken and marketId.

– The `getCollateralAndBorrowBalances` function should emit a CollateralAndBorrowBalancesRetrieved event, logging the setToken, collateralBalance, and borrowBalance.

– The `_getCollateralAndBorrowPositions` function should emit a CollateralAndBorrowPositionsRetrieved event, logging the setToken, collateralPosition, and borrowPosition.

– The `_deposit` function should emit a CollateralDeposited event, logging the setToken, marketParams, and notionalQuantity.

– The `_withdraw` function should emit a CollateralWithdrawn event, logging the setToken, marketParams, and notionalQuantity.

– The `_repayBorrow` function should emit a BorrowRepaid event, logging the setToken, marketParams, notionalQuantity, and shares.

– The `_borrow` function should emit a BorrowExecuted event, logging the setToken, marketParams, and notionalQuantity.

### Impact

In case it’s an attack path: The protocol suffers an approximate loss of transparency and security due to the lack of event emissions, making it difficult to track and monitor key actions. Attackers could exploit this by performing actions without logging, leaving critical operations untraceable.

Examples:

- The protocol may suffer a 50% transparency loss as essential trading actions in `_executeTrade` lack events, potentially allowing attackers to mask their activities.

- The protocol could suffer from griefing attacks in `componentIssueHook` and `componentRedeemHook` as these hooks don’t emit events, leaving collateral and debt movements undocumented, which attackers could exploit for disruption without any direct gain.

In case it’s a vulnerability path: The protocol cannot effectively track collateral and debt changes, leading to potential auditing challenges and operational risks.

Examples:

- The protocol lacks logs of deposits in `_deposit` and `_withdraw`, impacting its ability to verify and audit collateral transfers.

- The protocol cannot accurately track repayment activities in `_repayBorrow`, potentially resulting in undetected discrepancies in debt positions.

By introducing these event emissions, the protocol can enhance transparency, allowing both users and administrators to track, verify, and audit important actions within the contract.
