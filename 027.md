# The Property (The tokens morpho position should not be liquidatable assuming that the rebalance / iterateRebalance methods are called whenever the shouldRebalance method indicates necessity to do that) can potentially break and can cause liquidation.

### Summary

This property can break with a certain edge case that can lead users to get liquidated.

### Root Cause

Lets assume ripcord is excecuted, thus creating a cooldown on calling it again(the ripcord function uses it's own TWAP cooldown period), now lets say there is market volatility and the current leverage ratio now exceeds the incentivized leverage ratio(it went up right after ripcord excecution in a very short period of time {{seconds}}, now neither rebalance or iteraterebalance can be called(due to current leverage ratio being greater then the incentivized leverage ratio) by the keeper bots(as it happened in such a small amount of time and the market volatility made the leverage go above incentivized ratio in just a few seconds), now ripcord can also not be called again (due to having its own TWAP cooldown period), this makes the leverage ratio very high(Function disengage is the only way to _delever or _deleverToZeroBorrowBalance{operator function}, it might also take calling disengage multiple times before it can lever down to at least below the incentivized leverage ratio(if the leverage ratio is very high it can not lever down to max leverage ratio in just 1 run) {{even more times if the condition wants to excecute deleverToZeroBorrowBalance}}, but assuming this happened in a short amount of time there is a huge chance that before disengage is called(by the operator) and potentially needs to be excecuted multiple times(the operator might have to call it multiple times if the leverage ratio goes way up) the position already gets liquidated thus breaking this property.

### Internal pre-conditions

function ripcord is called right before the market volatility happens
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L396

### External pre-conditions
Market volatility making the leverage ratio in the protcol go higher then the incentivized leverage ratio in seconds.

### Attack Path

An user can see the market volatility and liquidate morpho positions(for there profit) before the disengage is executed{potentially multiple times}
### Impact

This edge case can break --This Property-- {{The tokens morpho position should not be liquidatable assuming that the rebalance / iterateRebalance methods are called whenever the shouldRebalance method indicates necessity to do that}}(as rebalance and iteraterebalance cannot be called by the keeper bots{{due to current leverage ratio being greater then incentivized leverage ratio and as this happened in such a small amount of time and the market volatility made the current leverage ratio go above incentivized leverage ratio in just a few seconds}} ((also function ripcord having a cooldown as it was called right before the market volatility happened)) --therefore entering liquidation territory and potentially even be liquidated -- thus impacting the users on the protocol greatly and breaking the property of the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
A new leverage ratio(emergency leverage ratio) can be added and set higher then usual so if the current leverage ratio reaches or goes above this new emergency  leverage ratio the  function rebalance can be called by keeper bots regardless of any other situation
