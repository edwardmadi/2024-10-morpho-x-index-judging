# Potential DoS Vector in MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension::getChunkRebalanceNotional

### Summary

The getChunkRebalanceNotional function in MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension is an external function without access restrictions that uses an unbounded loop over a user-supplied array, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### Root Cause

The getChunkRebalanceNotional function in MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension is an external function without access restrictions that uses an unbounded loop over a user-supplied array, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

```
function getChunkRebalanceNotional(
    string[] calldata _exchangeNames
)
    external
    view
    returns(uint256[] memory sizes, address sellAsset, address buyAsset)
{
    // ... (previous code omitted for brevity)

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _exchangeNames.length; i++) {
        // ... (loop body)
    }

    // ... (remaining code)
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The function is marked as external and view.
2. The function accepts an array of exchange names as input.


### External pre-conditions

1. Any external actor can call this function with an arbitrarily large array of exchange names.


### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls getChunkRebalanceNotional with an extremely large array of exchange names.
2. The function attempts to process all entries, consuming a large amount of gas.
3. If the gas consumption exceeds the block gas limit, the function becomes uncallable.


### Impact

1. Denial of Service: The function could become unusable if called with a large enough array, preventing legitimate calls.
2. Gas Exhaustion: Calls to this function with large arrays could consume excessive amounts of gas, leading to transaction failures.
3. Contract Liveness: If this function is critical for other operations, its unavailability could impact the overall functionality of the contract.
4. Economic Loss: Failed transactions due to out-of-gas errors still cost gas, potentially leading to economic losses for users.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a limit on the number of exchange names that can be processed:

```
function getChunkRebalanceNotional(
    string[] calldata _exchangeNames
)
    external
    view
    returns(uint256[] memory sizes, address sellAsset, address buyAsset)
{
    require(_exchangeNames.length <= MAX_EXCHANGES, "Too many exchanges");

    // ... (rest of the function implementation)
}
```
