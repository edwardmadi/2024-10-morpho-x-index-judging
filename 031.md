# Some functions that use invokeApprove() may revert when USDT is used.

### Summary

Trying to approve USDT when there is already non-zero approval will cause some functions to revert.

### Root Cause

Unlike most ERC-20 tokens, USDT's approve() function reverts if the current approval is non-zero and a new approval is being set without first resetting it to zero.  Functions like _deposit(), _repayBorrow(), and _executeTrade() in MorphoLeverageModule.sol invoke the invokeApprove() method to grant Morpho the right to transfer tokens from the SetToken contract. If there is a leftover nonzero approval for USDT, the transaction will revert due to this non-standard behavior.

### Internal pre-conditions

There should be a leftover non-zero approval for this issue to happen.

### External pre-conditions

Using Morpho markets with USDT.

### Attack Path

1.Suppose _setToken.invokeApprove() has already approved some amount of USDT for the morpho address, but not all tokens were used or transferred.
2.If a new transaction is initiated where the leftover approval is non-zero, the contract will attempt to update the approval amount.
3. USDT expects the approval to be set to zero first, and then a new approval can be assigned. Without this, calling approve() will cause the transaction to revert.
4. The failure in resetting the approval value will cause invokeApprove() to revert, leading to a failure in downstream functions that rely on approvals (e.g., _deposit(), _repayBorrow(), _executeTrade()).

### Impact

Some functions reverting causing the protocol to be unfunctional.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This issue is was also reported for the current protocol's previous audit and the fix used there can also be applied for this module.

``` _invokeApproveWithReset(address(_asset), address(_lendingPool), _notionalQuantity);```
