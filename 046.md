# `MorphoLeverageModule._executeTrade` may not work with some tokens such as USDT

### Summary

The USDT token requires first resetting to 0 when changing the allowance, which is not done with `_executeTrade`.

### Root Cause

When changing the allowance for the next trade, the allowance should first be set to 0 for USDT.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

After the previous exchange using `exchange Adapter` the allowance was not fully used, which is why its value is different from 0.

### Attack Path

The `lever` / `delever` function can be called with various adapters to perform a token exchange, depending on the implementation, they may not fully utilize the granted allowance for the token being exchanged. This will result in tokens such as USDT not being able to perform another trade, because changing from a non-zero allowance to another one is not possible.

### Impact

Attempting to call the `lever` / `delever` function and similar ones using the internal function `_executeTrade` will cause the transaction to revert. This will make the position unable to be balanced, which may lead to liquidation and financial loss.

Additionally, the main functions of the module will not work correctly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

As in modules already implemented, e.g. `AaveV3LeverageModule`, you should first change the allowance to 0 and only then set a new non-zero value.
