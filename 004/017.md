# Main functionalities are broken because `collateralValue` is not in borrow asset base units

### Summary

Bad `collateralValue` calculation will cause a DoS for the protocol's main functionalities such as:

-  `rebalance(...)`
- `iterateEebalance(...)`
- `ripcord(...)`
- `disengage(...)`

In some cases, these functions will not revert but some calculations will be wrong causing unintended behaviours from the protocol

### Root Cause

In `MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol:1056`:
`return_collateralValue.preciseDiv(_collateralValue.sub(_borrowBalance));` will revert exactly at the `sub()` operation.

This is due to a wrong value of the `_collateralValue` parameter that was passed as argument to the `_calculateCurrentLeverageRatio(...)` function after it was wrongly calculated inside the `createAction(...)` function:
[bad collateralValue calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L924)
`if collateral = usdc, then collateralValue = 1e36 * 1e6 / 1e36 = 1e6 (expressed in usdc base units, not in borrow asset's base units)`

P.S: The values I used are an approximation, we will get a collateralValue of the order of 1e6, not the base units of the borrowed asset that is not even mentioned in the calculation

It was specified that collateralValue will be expressed in the borrowed asset's base units but it isn't: 
`uint256 collateralValue;                        // Valuation of collateral in borrow asset base units`
It's very likely that: `collateralValue < _borrowBalance` especially when they don't have the same base units

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `borrowBalance > _collateralValue`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. One of these is called:
-  `rebalance(...)`
- `iterateEebalance(...)`
- `ripcord(...)`
- `disengage(...)`

2. `_getAndValidateLeveragedInfo(...)` is called (subcall)
3. `_createActionInfo()` is called (subcall) creating a corrupted actionInfo with a bad collateralValue
4. `_calculateCurrentLeverageRatio()`is called (subcall) and might revert if `borrowBalance > _collateralValue` or just return a wrong `currentLeverageRatio` variable

### Impact

A lot of the main functionalities of the protocol will not work when being called as they might revert, if they don't revert, the protocol will behave in an unintended way:
- when trying to rebalance `currentLeverageRatio` variable will be wrong and the rebalance state will be wrongly updated
- same for iterate state
- when trying to return leverage ratio back to the max leverage ratio by calling the ripcord function might revert on several occasions preventing the caller from receiving his reward in ETH
- disengage might also revert or execute bad delevers, which can result in _additional units of the borrow asset added as equity on the SetToken due to oracle price / market price mismatch_, when it shouldn't

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the issue by calculating collateralValue in a way that it becomes in borrow asset base units
