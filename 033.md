# _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional will calculate incorrectly when the borrow balance is 0

### Summary

engage function is designed to engage with the debt position for the first time to target leverage ratio the function implements checks to ensure the collateral balance is more than 0 total supply is more than 0 and borrowbalance is 0 (to ensure there is no outstanding debt) as the function is designed to engage with the position for the first time the engage function calls _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional to calculate the amount for leveraging however this is flawed and will lead to issues when trying to calculate the amount due to the following reason

    function engage(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyOperator {
        _enterCollateralPosition();


        ActionInfo memory engageInfo = _createActionInfo();
        require(engageInfo.setTotalSupply > 0, "SetToken must have > 0 supply");
        require(engageInfo.collateralBalance > 0, "Collateral balance must be > 0");
        require(engageInfo.borrowBalance == 0, "Debt must be 0"); /////@audit ensures the borrowbalance is 0


        LeverageInfo memory leverageInfo = LeverageInfo({
            action: engageInfo,
            currentLeverageRatio: PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit(), // 1x leverage in precise units
            slippageTolerance: execution.slippageTolerance,
            twapMaxTradeSize: exchangeSettings[_exchangeName].twapMaxTradeSize,
            exchangeName: _exchangeName
        });


        // Calculate total rebalance units and kick off TWAP if above max borrow or max trade size
        (
            uint256 chunkRebalanceNotional,
            uint256 totalRebalanceNotional
        ) = _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional(leverageInfo, methodology.targetLeverageRatio, true); ////@audit calls calculatechunkrebalancenotional to calculate the amount


now in the _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional

    function _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional(
        LeverageInfo memory _leverageInfo,
        uint256 _newLeverageRatio,
        bool _isLever
    )
        internal
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256, uint256)
    {
        // Calculate absolute value of difference between new and current leverage ratio
        uint256 leverageRatioDifference = _isLever ? _newLeverageRatio.sub(_leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio) : _leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio.sub(_newLeverageRatio);


        uint256 totalRebalanceNotional = leverageRatioDifference.preciseDiv(_leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio).preciseMul(_leverageInfo.action.collateralBalance);


        uint256 maxBorrow = _calculateMaxBorrowCollateral(_leverageInfo.action, _isLever);


        uint256 chunkRebalanceNotional = Math.min(Math.min(maxBorrow, totalRebalanceNotional), _leverageInfo.twapMaxTradeSize);


        return (chunkRebalanceNotional, totalRebalanceNotional);


as we can see in the calculatechunkrebalancenotional for when islever is true the calculation looks like this

it firstcalculates the leveragedifferenceratio by subtracting newleverageratio with currentleverageratio 
and then in the totalrebalancenotional the calculation goes like this  

        uint256 totalRebalanceNotional = leverageRatioDifference.preciseDiv(_leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio).preciseMul(_leverageInfo.action.collateralBalance);

       

as you can see the code divides the leverageratiodifference by currentleverageratio this is wrong and will lead to incorrect calculations because when the borrowbalance is 0 the currentleverageratio will be zero (confirmed by sponsors) 

calculation will look like this
collateralbalance = 100 (for simplicity)
newlevrageratio = 1
currentleverageratio=0
newleverage ratio - currentleverageratio = 1 

leverageRatioDifference = 1

uint256 totalRebalanceNotional = leverageRatioDifference.preciseDiv(_leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio).preciseMul(_leverageInfo.action.collateralBalance);
= 0

This line will set totalRebalanceNotional to 0 if the current leverage ratio is 0
as we can see this is problematic and will completely dos engage

### Internal pre-conditions

borrowbalance=0'
leverageratio = 0


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

protocol wont be able to borrow engage will be completely DOSed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Handle the case when the borrow balance is 0 and the position is being engaged for the first time gracefully
