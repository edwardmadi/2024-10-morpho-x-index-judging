# Calculation of leverage ratio is not as intended

### Summary

The struct `MethodologySettings`  has a field called `recenteringSpeed` [which states](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L98) that it is used as a value to go back to the `targetLeverageRatio` and it is used in `_calculateNewLeverageRatio()`. 

The issue stems from that the calculation **doesn't make** the `_currentLeverageRatio` go to the `targetLeverageRatio`, 
just as a percentage of `recenteringSpeed`

### Root Cause

The problem stems from the following:
Let's say we have a `minLeverageRatio` of 2,  `maxLeverageRatio` of 3,  `targetLeverageRatio` of 2.5, 
  `_currentLeverageRatio` of 2.25 and `recenteringSpeed` being equal to a value corresponding to  `15%`.

(I will use floating numbers for simplicity, we all know Solidity works with whole numbers only)

`a` will be -> 2.5 * 1.15 = 2.875
`b` will be -> 0.85 * 2.25 = 1.9125
`c` will be -> a + b = 4.7875
`d` will take the minimum value between `c` and `maxLeverageRatio`, which will be later in our example -> 3
and the return statement will take the max value between `minLeverageRatio` and `d` which will be again the latter of -> 3

We started with a  `_currentLeverageRatio` of 2.25 and right now we are at `maxLeverageRatio` of 3 after the calculation which is against the specified comment and is a lot more volatile than anticipated, given the 15% of `recenteringSpeed`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Keeper bot sees that it can call `rebalance()` and calls it
2. Inside it, we execute `_calculateNewLeverageRatio()` to calculate the new leverage ratio
3. The calculation is a lot more volatile than expected and results in unexpected behaviour

### Impact

The impact is an incorrect leverage calculation, resulting in a potentially lost funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Rewrite the `_calculateNewLeverageRatio()` with a logic changing the `_currentLeverageRatio` correctly given the `recenteringSpeed`, so it works as expected
