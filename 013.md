# Integer Overflow Risks in MorphoSharesMath.sol

### Summary

The use of SafeMath in MorphoSharesMath.sol does not fully protect against integer overflow in all operations, which could cause incorrect share calculations. This may lead to a loss of funds for users as an attacker could manipulate inputs to exploit these overflow conditions.

### Root Cause

In MorphoSharesMath.sol, the mulDivDown and mulDivUp functions from MorphoMathLib are used, which may not have adequate overflow protection for all scenarios.

### Internal pre-conditions

 The totalAssets and totalShares values must be large enough to potentially cause overflow when added to VIRTUAL_ASSETS and VIRTUAL_SHARES respectively.
The assets or shares input must be large enough to potentially cause overflow when multiplied with the adjusted totalShares or totalAssets

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

An attacker identifies a situation where totalAssets or totalShares are close to type(uint256).max.
The attacker calls a function that uses toSharesDown, toAssetsDown, or toAssetsUp with carefully chosen inputs.
The addition of VIRTUAL_ASSETS or VIRTUAL_SHARES causes an overflow.
The subsequent multiplication in mulDivDown or mulDivUp may cause another overflow.

### Impact

Users of the protocol could suffer significant financial losses due to incorrect share calculations. The exact impact would depend on how these functions are used in the broader context of the protocol, but it could potentially lead to draining of funds from the protocol.

### PoC

```solidity
function testOverflow() public {
    uint256 maxUint = type(uint256).max;
    uint256 assets = 1;
    uint256 totalAssets = maxUint - VIRTUAL_ASSETS + 1;
    uint256 totalShares = 1000;

    // This will overflow
    uint256 shares = MorphoSharesMath.toSharesDown(assets, totalAssets, totalShares);

    // shares will be an unexpectedly large number
    assert(shares > totalShares);
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement additional checks in the toSharesDown, toAssetsDown, and toAssetsUp functions to ensure that the additions and multiplications won't overflow.

Example mitigation for toSharesDown:

```solidity
function toSharesDown(uint256 assets, uint256 totalAssets, uint256 totalShares) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    require(totalAssets <= type(uint256).max - VIRTUAL_ASSETS, "Total assets too large");
    require(totalShares <= type(uint256).max - VIRTUAL_SHARES, "Total shares too large");
    uint256 adjustedTotalAssets = totalAssets.add(VIRTUAL_ASSETS);
    uint256 adjustedTotalShares = totalShares.add(VIRTUAL_SHARES);
    require(assets <= type(uint256).max / adjustedTotalShares, "Assets too large");
    return assets.mulDivDown(adjustedTotalShares, adjustedTotalAssets);
}
```
