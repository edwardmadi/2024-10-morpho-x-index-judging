# Name Of _exchangeName In MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol Is Not Unique

### Summary

In  ```function engage(string memory _exchangeName) external onlyOperator {
    _enterCollateralPosition();``` 
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L274C4-L275C36

_exchangeName is not unique and errors can be made if a name is duplicated for two different leverage positions

### Root Cause

- The choice to not require the  ```_exchangeName``` parameter to be unique will lead to the contract not having a way to differentiate between them, if a name is mistakenly passed twice by the operator
-  emitting of  an event  having multiple positions with the same name would lead to difficulties in tracking events on-chain

### Internal pre-conditions

1. operator opens a leverage position with eth/usdc at position A
2. operator does not keep track of the name and opens another leverage position on eth/usdc at another on position B

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1.  When the function is called, it not know which position to reference. leading to errors inliquidation, rebalancing, or withdrawing assets
2. Incorrect emit of events  would make monitoring and debugging difficult as it would be hard to distinguish between events related to different leverage positions
3. Users might inadvertently engage with the wrong position or have difficulty understanding their current holdings and liabilities.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. require statement to ensure ```_exchangeName``` is unique
1. unique names can be enforced by mapping of active leverage positions against a new position to be created
