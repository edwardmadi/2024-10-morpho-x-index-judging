# Slippage in `_executeTrade` function will lead to potential losses for users, as they may receive fewer tokens than expected in `MorphoLeverageModule.sol`

### Summary

The `_executeTrade` function in the contract imposes a check for slippage control, requiring that the post-trade balance is greater than or equal to the `minNotionalReceiveQuantity`. However, this check alone may not sufficiently protect against significant slippage, especially in volatile or low-liquidity markets. If market conditions change or the slippage tolerance is set too high, it can lead to potential losses for users, as they may receive fewer tokens than expected.

### Root Cause

In decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. In this contract, the function `_executeTrade` allows users to specify a minimum amount of tokens they expect to receive from a trade. However, if the trade occurs in a volatile or illiquid market, the actual amount received can deviate significantly, leading to slippage.
The following is the relevant portion of the `_executeTrade` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/MorphoLeverageModule.sol#L783-L823
```solidity
function _executeTrade(
    ActionInfo memory _actionInfo,
    IERC20 _sendToken,
    IERC20 _receiveToken,
    bytes memory _data
) internal returns (uint256) {
    ISetToken setToken = _actionInfo.setToken;
    uint256 notionalSendQuantity = _actionInfo.notionalSendQuantity;

    setToken.invokeApprove(
        address(_sendToken),
        _actionInfo.exchangeAdapter.getSpender(),
        notionalSendQuantity
    );

    (
        address targetExchange,
        uint256 callValue,
        bytes memory methodData
    ) = _actionInfo.exchangeAdapter.getTradeCalldata(
        address(_sendToken),
        address(_receiveToken),
        address(setToken),
        notionalSendQuantity,
        _actionInfo.minNotionalReceiveQuantity,
        _data
    );

    setToken.invoke(targetExchange, callValue, methodData);

    uint256 receiveTokenQuantity = _receiveToken.balanceOf(address(setToken)).sub(_actionInfo.preTradeReceiveTokenBalance);
    require(
        receiveTokenQuantity >= _actionInfo.minNotionalReceiveQuantity,
        "Slippage too high"
    );

    return receiveTokenQuantity;
}
```
In this function, the slippage check is performed after the trade:
```solidity
require(
    receiveTokenQuantity >= _actionInfo.minNotionalReceiveQuantity,
    "Slippage too high"
);
```
This check verifies that the received amount of tokens is at least as much as the minimum expected quantity (`_actionInfo.minNotionalReceiveQuantity`). However, in volatile or low-liquidity markets, this value may still allow for significant losses due to slippage.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Set up a low-liquidity token pool.
2. Simulate a trade where the `minNotionalReceiveQuantity` is set too low.
3. Execute the trade using the `_executeTrade` function.
4. Observe that the amount of tokens received is much lower than expected due to slippage.

### Impact

1. Users may receive significantly fewer tokens than they expect when trades are executed in volatile or low-liquidity markets. This could result in financial losses for users relying on the trade.
2. If users consistently experience unexpected slippage, it could erode trust in the platform, particularly in DeFi applications where users rely on the accuracy of trades.
The potential for financial loss in volatile or low-liquidity markets makes this vulnerability a high severity issue. If exploited, users could lose a significant amount of their assets due to slippage.

### PoC

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Slippage Vulnerability in _executeTrade", function () {
  let setToken, exchangeAdapter, sendToken, receiveToken, user;

  before(async function () {
    [user] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Deploy mock tokens and exchange adapter for the test
    const Token = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20Mock");
    sendToken = await Token.deploy("Send Token", "SND", 18, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
    receiveToken = await Token.deploy("Receive Token", "RCV", 18, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));

    const ExchangeAdapter = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockExchangeAdapter");
    exchangeAdapter = await ExchangeAdapter.deploy();

    const SetToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("SetToken");
    setToken = await SetToken.deploy(sendToken.address, receiveToken.address, exchangeAdapter.address);
  });

  it("should allow high slippage trades", async function () {
    // Initial setup
    const notionalSendQuantity = ethers.utils.parseEther("100");
    const minNotionalReceiveQuantity = ethers.utils.parseEther("10"); // High slippage tolerance

    // Simulate a high slippage trade
    await sendToken.connect(user).approve(setToken.address, notionalSendQuantity);
    await setToken.connect(user)._executeTrade(
      notionalSendQuantity, 
      minNotionalReceiveQuantity
    );

    // Check balances to verify slippage occurred
    const receiveTokenBalance = await receiveToken.balanceOf(user.address);
    expect(receiveTokenBalance).to.be.below(ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
    expect(receiveTokenBalance).to.be.above(minNotionalReceiveQuantity); // Trade succeeds but with slippage
  });
});
```
The test shows that a trade with significant slippage can still succeed as long as the amount received is above the minimum threshold, even though the user receives much less than expected.

### Mitigation

1. Allow users to set stricter limits for slippage, so that trades will revert if the received token quantity deviates too much from the expected amount.
2. Notify users if the slippage exceeds a certain threshold, allowing them to reconsider the trade before it executes.
3. Introduce a circuit breaker that halts trades if excessive slippage is detected, preventing large losses during periods of market volatility.
