# Mispricing in `issue` and `redeem` during ongoing rebalance

### Summary

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L358

when doing `iterateRebalance`, it can last over long period of time where instantaneous leverage is out of bounds of expected leverage.

When user `mints` or `redeems` set token, they are either paying and premium or receiving a discount due to position not being in ideal state and hence not accounting for cost to reach there (slippage, lever/delever fees, etc.)

### Root Cause

- `issue` and `burn` are allowed during `iterateRebalance`

### Internal pre-conditions

- `IterateRebalance` is ongoing when user is minting or redeeming

### External pre-conditions

- N/A

### Attack Path

- `iterateRebalance` followed by `burn` or `mint`

### Impact

- A user might be able to redeem at a premium price on set token temporarily
- A user might be able to mint set token at discount temporarily

### PoC

N/A 

### Mitigation

- `lock` and `unlock` in setToken when iterate `rebalance` is in progress
- any other mechanism which prevents minting from debt issuance module when `rebalance` is in progress
