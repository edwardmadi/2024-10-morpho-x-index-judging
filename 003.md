# Delever can be bricked leading to unwanted liquidations

### Summary

The `delever` function calls the `_setToken.invokeApprove` function through the `_repayBorrow` function. If loan token is USDT it will cause the `delever` function to revert as USDT doesn't allow the token to be approved again when the approved amount is already more than 0. This could cause the `delever` function to be permanently blocked if USDT is used as the loan token which eventually could cause unwanted liquidations.

### Root Cause

The `delever` function relies on the `_repayBorrow` function.

Inside the `_repayBorrow` function, the  `_setToken.invokeApprove` function is called to approve the required token before it calls `_setToken.invokeRepay` function. The `_setToken.invokeRepay` function in some chances will not necessarily use all the approved amount because the post trade amount can be greater than the (borrowed amount + interest rate) . As a result it's highly likely there will be some leftover approved amount. The logic inside the `_repayBorrow` function is fine for most ERC20 tokens, however this will fail for some tokens like USDT the second time this function is called, as USDT doesn't allow the token to be approved again with an amount more than 0 when the approved amount is already more than 0.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. USDT is used as the loan token
2. USDT approval amount is already > 0

### Attack Path

1. SetToken manager call delever with USDT as loan token.
2. SetToken manager call delever (again) with USDT as loan token.  (Transaction reverted)

### Impact
Delever can be bricked which is the function indirectly used by every user using morpho extension which could lead to unwanted liquidations for users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
In the `_repayBorrow` function:
If loan token used is USDT then check if the approval amount is already more than 0 if yes skip the approval. Alternatively, call the approval with 0 amount to reset the approval amount to 0, then call again with the real approval amount.
