# Incentivized Leverage Ratio Validation Vulnerability

### Summary

An incorrect validation in the `_validateNonExchangeSettings` function in `MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol` allows the `incentivizedLeverageRatio` to be set equal to the `maxLeverageRatio`. This can lead to conflicting conditions where both normal rebalancing and the incentivized emergency rebalancing (`ripcord()`) are triggered at the same leverage ratio, causing delays in rebalancing, increased liquidation risk, and possible loss for users.

### Root Cause

In [`MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L971), the following validation check allows the `incentivizedLeverageRatio` to be equal to the `maxLeverageRatio`, rather than enforcing that it be strictly greater:

```solidity
require(
  _incentive.incentivizedLeverageRatio >= _methodology.maxLeverageRatio,
  "Incentivized leverage ratio must be greater than max leverage ratio"
);
```

This incorrect condition can lead to both regular rebalancing and incentivized rebalancing (`ripcord()`) being triggered simultaneously, potentially blocking or delaying critical rebalancing actions.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The operator sets `_incentive.incentivizedLeverageRatio` equal to `_methodology.maxLeverageRatio`.
2. The leverage ratio of the protocol reaches the `maxLeverageRatio` due to market conditions.

### External pre-conditions

1. The market experiences high volatility, driving the current leverage ratio of the protocol to its maximum.
2. No immediate corrective action (such as calling `ripcord()` or normal `rebalance()`) is taken due to conflicting conditions.

### Attack Path

1. The protocol's current leverage ratio reaches the `maxLeverageRatio`.
2. The regular `rebalance()` function is allowed to execute due to the leverage ratio hitting the maximum threshold.
3. Simultaneously, the emergency `ripcord()` function is also triggered as the `incentivizedLeverageRatio` equals the `maxLeverageRatio`.
4. These conflicting rebalancing mechanisms may result in delays, missed rebalances, or blocked rebalancing due to confusion in which process takes precedence.

### Impact

The protocol's users are at risk of losing collateral due to delayed rebalancing or increased liquidation risk. During volatile market conditions, both the `rebalance()` and `ripcord()` functions could be simultaneously triggered, causing confusion and delays. This can result in the protocol failing to restore a safe leverage ratio in time, leading to user losses due to liquidations or incorrect rebalancing.

Estimated Loss:
- The users may suffer collateral liquidation if the leverage ratio is not timely restored.
- The protocol could experience instability during high-leverage situations.

### PoC

No coded PoC is necessary, as this is a logical vulnerability based on the leverage ratio validation check. A test case with market conditions driving the leverage ratio to maxLeverageRatio would illustrate the issue.

### Mitigation

Change the validation condition to ensure that the `incentivizedLeverageRatio` is strictly greater than the `maxLeverageRatio`:

```solidity
require(
  _incentive.incentivizedLeverageRatio > _methodology.maxLeverageRatio,
  "Incentivized leverage ratio must be greater than max leverage ratio"
);
```

This will ensure that there is no overlap between the conditions for normal rebalancing and incentivized rebalancing (`ripcord()`), reducing the risk of rebalancing conflicts and ensuring a smooth operation of the protocol under high-leverage conditions.
