# rebalance() and iterateRebalance() can be DOS-ed in a particular scenario

### Summary

Both `rebalance()` and `iterateBalance()` are meant to be currently called by only keeper bots and in following scenarios -> when the `_currentLeverageRatio` is below `minLeverageRatio` and above the `maxLeverageRatio` or when the cooldown (global or exchange) has passed.

But in the contest's description, it is stated that in the future, the functions with the `onlyAllowedCaller` modifier (this include both the functions) may be called by anyone:
Here is the bullet point present in Sherlock's contest description **However in the future we might adjust the contract settings such that anyone can call these methods (any method with the onlyAllowedCaller modifier), so we would still like to know about any issue that could result in that scenario.**

This presents a likely scenario in which we can DOS most or all exchanges.

### Root Cause

Root cause is that in the future, it can be allowed that everyone has the ability to invoke `rebalance()` and `iterateRebalance()` and this can be **detrimental to the protocol's integrity** in the following way:

Let's assume that the `_currentLeverageRatio` is x3.05 and the `maxLeverageRatio` is x3 and that no TWAP will occur.

A malicious user calls `rebalance()` to bring back the overly leveraged position (x3.05) back to the maximum leverage (x3),
(if the leverage is just a little above max, it will bring it back to the `_maxLeverageRatio` due to [this line of code and the calculations prior to it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1074) and all of that is intended for now, BUT...

Then the malicious user will have the possibility to call `_rebalance()` even if the `_currentLeverageRatio` goes just above the x3 mark, this means that the slightest price change, he can call again `_rebalance()` with a different exchange and bring back the leverage again to the `_maxLeverageRatio` and this can continue on and on. 

Let's assume that the x3 leverage ratio is when ETH price is 2500 USDC, even if it falls with a few dollars, it will bring the possibility to call the `rebalance()` due to the logic below.  

**Remember that** the `_coolDown` will pass due to [this piece of code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1001C16-L1001C81)

All of this will render the `ripcord()` unusable as well, because it uses the [exchangeLastTradeTimestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L404) as well.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

`maxLeverageRatio` is x3 and `_currentLeverageRatio` is x3.05 for the example purpose, and we have 5 allowed exchanges to use in the vault and lastly, a volatile day in which ETH falls rapidly downwards and there've been **not just one** of those days, in which ETH falls with 3-10% for a few minutes in case of a real life event such as geopolitical events.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious `Alice` calls `rebalance()` to bring back the `_currentLeverageRatio` of x3.05 to the `maxLeverageRatio` of x3
2. The price of ETH against USDC continues to drop and `_currentLeverageRatio` is x3.02, so `Alice` calls `rebalance()` once again and the `_currentLeverageRatio` is brought back to the `maxLeverageRatio` once again.
3. Repeat this 4 more times, given that the price will drop, making the `_currentLeverageRatio` again x3.02, 
or just a little above the `_maxLeverageRatio`
4. Then, the price of ETH continues to drop more and hits the `incentivizedLeverageRatio` ,  `ripcord()` is to be called by non-malicious Bob, it will revert due to the logic here [exchangeLastTradeTimestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-morpho-x-index/blob/main/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/MorphoLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L404)

### Impact

Vault will suffer more losses than intended due to `ripcord()` not being callable,  
 and all of the exchanges being blocked from the cooldown by malicious `Alice`
