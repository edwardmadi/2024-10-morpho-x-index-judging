# Missing Debt Check in removeModule() Risks Unresolved Liabilities for SetToken Holders

### Summary

Missing check in the removeModule() function can lead to unpaid debt for SetToken holders, as the SetToken manager can remove the module even when there’s still outstanding debt. This leaves the SetToken in an unstable state, with unresolved liabilities that could potentially harm users.

### Root Cause

In the removeModule() in `MorphoLeverageModule.sol:456 `there’s no check ensuring that all debt has been repaid before the module is removed. This allows the manager to bypass debt obligations, which could lead to significant problems for users who hold the SetToken.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The SetToken manager needs to call removeModule() to remove the leveraging module.
2. The SetToken has active debt, and this debt is not explicitly paid off before removing the module.

### External pre-conditions

1. The SetToken has borrowed assets through the Morpho protocol.
2. No action is taken to repay or reduce the debt before calling removeModule().

### Attack Path

1. Alice, the SetToken manager, calls removeModule() to remove the leveraging module without first repaying the debt the SetToken owes.
2. Bob, a SetToken holder, is unaware that this action has left the SetToken in a state where it still holds debt, but no longer has the module to track or manage the repayment.
3. As a result, Bob and other users are exposed to the risk of loss, as they hold a SetToken with unresolved liabilities.

### Impact

SetToken holders  are left with debt that they cannot manage or repay because the module responsible for handling it has been removed. The SetToken manager might unintentionally or maliciously create a scenario where users lose out or are exposed to risks, especially if collateral drops in value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a strict check before the module can be removed. This ensures the SetToken cannot bypass debt repayment:

```solidity
(uint256 collateralBalance, uint256 borrowBalance, ) = _getCollateralAndBorrowBalances(setToken, marketParams[setToken]);
require(borrowBalance == 0, "Cannot remove module with outstanding debt");
```
By adding this check, the protocol will block any attempt to remove the module while debt is still owed, protecting users like Bob from unnecessary risks.
