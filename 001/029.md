# removemodule will delete marketparams even if there is existing debt

### Summary

removemodule function is designed to  remove module from the set tokens 
the comment says             
       "Removes this module from the SetToken, via call by the SetToken. Any deposited collateral assets
     *are disabled to be used as collateral on Morpho. Morpho market params state is deleted.
     * Note: Function should revert is there is any debt remaining on Morpho"
     
      however if there is a existing debt and the function reverts the market params will still get deleted 


         function removeModule()
        external
        override
        onlyValidAndInitializedSet(ISetToken(msg.sender))
    {
        ISetToken setToken = ISetToken(msg.sender);


        sync(setToken);


        delete marketParams[setToken]; ///@audit


        // Try if unregister exists on any of the modules
        address[] memory modules = setToken.getModules();
        for(uint256 i = 0; i < modules.length; i++) {
            try IDebtIssuanceModule(modules[i]).unregisterFromIssuanceModule(setToken) {} catch {}
        }
    }

this is problematic as it can lead to a situation where the function  delete the market parameters associated with the SetToken. it deletes any data stored under that tokens key

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

attempts to access the deleted parameters could lead to errors or incorrect behavior in the contract. this can lead to a situation where there is still existing debt but the parameters related are deleted which can be problematic for the protocol as the protocol heavily relies on these parameters when trying to access a debt position

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

dont delete the marketparams if there's existing debt position handle the situation gracefully
